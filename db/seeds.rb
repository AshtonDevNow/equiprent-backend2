# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


products = [
  {
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Motorcycle",
  "price": "130",
  "description": "With sidecar!"
 }
]
# products.each do |product|
#   prod = Product.create!(name: product[:name])
#   puts "product #{prod.name} has been created"
# end
